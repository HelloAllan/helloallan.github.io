# avocado

avocado is a simple, responsive, one-page Jekyll theme which helps you establish an
online presence with minimal effort. See a live demo at [willman.io](http://willman.io).

To use avocado with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- Fork this repository to your own account
- Edit `index.md` with your own personal information and biography
- Edit the site title and various social media URLs in `_config.yml`
- Optionally overwrite the image in `assets/images/flair.jpg` with your own content.
  For best results, the flair image should be around 500px in width and of a 9:16 aspect
  ratio.
